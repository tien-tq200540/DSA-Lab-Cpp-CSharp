# DSA-Lab-Cpp-CSharp
This is a personal learning repository for practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** in both **C++** and **C#** (CSharp).
---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Reinforce foundational DSA knowledge.
- Practice problem-solving and clean implementation in both **C++** and **C#** .
- Build a long-term reference for revisiting important data structures and algorithm patterns.

---

## 📺 Learning Resources

> All implementations are based on these two outstanding YouTube series:

1. **Data Structures by MyCodeSchool**  
   🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P)  
   📌 Great explanations with simple visualizations and beginner-friendly code in C/C++.

2. **Algorithms by Abdul Bari**  
   🔗 [Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDN4rrl48XKpZkf03iYFl-O29szjTrs_O)  
   📌 Deep dives into algorithm logic and recursion using whiteboard-style teaching.

```plaintext
/
├── Cpp/           → DSA implemented in C++
├── CSharp/        → DSA implemented in C#
├── .gitignore     → Clean repo, ignore build artifacts
├── README.md      → You are here!
```
Each language folder is structured by topic:
```
